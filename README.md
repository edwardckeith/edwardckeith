Hello👋🏾! I'm Edward, but you can call me Eddie😉. I go to school at Missouri S&T🏫 and major in Information Science and Technology, with a minor in Business Management Systems. I am the marketing lead for PickHacks, organizing and facilitating internal and external outreach efforts for the largest Hackathon event in the midwest🤠. I've been passionate about tech since I was little, and would love to find myself using tech to improve the lives of other people:)
