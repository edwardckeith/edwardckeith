Hello👋🏾! I'm Edward, but you can call me Eddie😉.
🏫I go to school at Missouri S&T and major in Information Science and Technology, with a minor in Business Management Systems.
🤠I am the marketing lead for PickHacks, organizing and facilitating internal and external outreach efforts for the largest Hackathon event in the midwest.
♠I've been passionate about tech since I was little, and would love to find myself using tech to improve the lives of other people:)
